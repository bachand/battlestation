# My Battlestation

Inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/. Spoiler alert: my actual battlestation is much less cool than any of these :stuck_out_tongue:

## Setting up

Clone the repo and run the setup command.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/bachand/battlestation.git
$ cd battlestation
$ ./bin/battlestation setup
```

## Gotchas

- [`setup`](bin/setup) must be run from a directory underneath this repo.
