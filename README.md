# My Battlestation

Inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/.

Spoiler alert: my actual battlestation is much less cool than any of these :stuck_out_tongue:

## Setting up

1. Clone the repo
2. Run the setup command:
```shell
$ cd $REPO_DIR
$ ./bin/battlestation setup
```

## Gotchas

- [`setup`](bin/setup) must be run from a directory underneath this repo.
